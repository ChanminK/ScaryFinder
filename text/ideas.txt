Okay basic akinator game web thingy where you can 
guesss/take in answers to get the perfect scare that will
scare them 

MAKE THE AKINATOR BUT BE AN ORHPEOUS VERSION INSTEAD

FIND OUT HOW AKINATOR WORKS
    not sure what kinda databses it uses...
    I mean gpt is saying that it uses a belief system that works based on a percentage

Typescript + react for ui
typescript for backend

Current scare json setup copy+paste:

        {
            "id": "",
            "title": "",
            "category": "",
            "intensity": #,
            "tags": [""],
            "safetyFlags": [""],
            "media": {
                "poster": "assets/",
                "jump": "assets/"
            },
            "contentWarnings": ["", ""],
            "rights": { "source": "local-prototype", "license": "prototype-only", "creator": "you" }
        },

id = name for the thingy for backend
title = what the user will see when they encounter it
category = containers like movies, games, etc 
intentisy = how scary the scene is (ON MY BASIS)
tags = discriptors to trigger certain options as on 
media: file path
    jump = main mp4 
    image = if jumpscare is an image
    audio = extra audio i may add if its an img

MAYBE IMPLEMENT

    poster = preview of each scare(think yt thumbnail) 

safetyFlags = just in case they have a thing where they cant see flashing lights
    FOR NOW JUST PUT A WARNING FOR THE FIRST PAGE YOU SEE WHERE THE USER HAS TO CONFIRM YES

contentWarnings = y'know like just in case
    ALSO ADD IT INTO THE FIRST PAGE
rights = licensing stuff
    honestly if i do add add this ill do it eventually perhaps
